A python2.7 script that removes duplicate songs in google play music using the gmusicapi.

To get the program running, you need to make sure you have the gmusicapi installed.

Why is this necessary? Doesn't google play music delete duplicates of the SAME SONG FROM THE SAME ALBUM?

For some reason nope and every single time I synced my local songs to google play, it would always re-add existing songs.
