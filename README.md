A python2.7 script that removes duplicate songs in google play music using the gmusicapi.

To get the program running, you need to make sure you have the gmusicapi installed.

Why is this necessary? Doesn't google play music do this by itself?

For some reason nope and every single time I synced my local songs to google play, it would always re-add existing songs.
